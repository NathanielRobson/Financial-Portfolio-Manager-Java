# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

Our team has agreed that we have worked efficiently together, this is because of our continuous collaboration and our weekly efforts.
Each team member has contributed equally to tasks assigned in a timely manner and has helped when a team member is falling behind schedule. Our team is progressing slowly and effectively, this shown in our program progress. This is due to ensure that there are no bugs and that the program works appropriately.

The scrum meetings were all held during the mornings with each meeting not being longer than 15 minutes most team members being present with few missing due to sickness or other circumstances. Most meetings were effective with tasks being sets for team members to be completed individually or has a group.
Communication within the group was moderate with team members communicating with one another when issues within the project surfaced or when members were behind scheduled tasks. 
Not many issues surfaced while communicating with one another, due the fact that members would always make sure that they would inform the team if any issue surfaced with their task or if they were going to be absent during any of the meetings.
