# Risk Log
In this section list the risks you have identified for your project.

## Meeting Completion Deadline - https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/projects/CE291T3/issues/CE291T3-39
Meeting the deadline is one of the risks we have highlighted as a team due to the difficult start our team has had because of the switching of group members and some absences due to illness. We are all working on this and are actively putting the hours into the project to ensure we meet our deadline on time with a well-made and finished product.
## Program Bugs - https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/projects/CE291T3/issues/CE291T3-40
As with any programming task, bugs are to be expected and we actively tackle these problems in our code. We even had a story on Jira assigning one of our members – Nathaniel, to debug the code at different stages of the development process.
## Ensure CSV File Up to Date - https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/projects/CE291T3/issues/CE291T3-41
We also want to make sure that the .CSV files we use are up to date so that we interpret the correct data and keep our information as accurate as possible. We are mitigating this issue by constantly using the most up to date files available.
