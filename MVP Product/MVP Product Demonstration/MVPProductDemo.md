# MVP Demonstration

*This is a demonstration of our MVP Product which is a Financial Portfolio Manager.*

*This program comes with a .csv file that contains information about Netflix stocks. This file is needed to run the program correctly.*

When you run the program the window seen below is shown:

![File Browser](MVP Product/MVP Product Demonstration/Screenshots/File_Browser.png) ![File Browser 2](MVP Product/MVP Product Demonstration/Screenshots/File_Browser_2.png)

This is a file browser that allows the user to find the location of the .csv file mentioned above.

After selecting the .csv file and clicking the 'Open' button the following window will be shown:

This window allows the user to enter a date using the format specified in the window text.

After entering a date and clicking the 'OK' button the program will use the date entered to search for a record in the .csv file.

The results of this search will then be displayed in the window seen below:
