# Project Management Log
## Project management discussion
Teams do not become effective overnight. Team building is a process that requires due attention and care. To ensure our team progressively developed effectively, throughout the development process of our program we would always offer support, extra participation and leading where possible to allow each member to output their best work. Our team worked well on tasks individually assigned and thrived on producing well polished products before deadlines. There is definitely room for improvement when working on parts of the project which require more than one persons input and this is where we hope to see improvement in future implementations.

The program has progressed very effectively since our MVP, in our eyes our product meets the user requirement specified and has evolved to become what we envisioned from the beginning. We are proud of what we have produced and look forward to receiving user feedback.

The teams weekly scrum meetings each week were aimed at three main questions, 'What did we accomplish since the last meeting?', 'What will each individual be working towards when we arrive at the next meeting?' and 'What is preventing us as a team from completing the task at hand?'. Asking these three questions at each meeting allowed our team to target which tasks need the most focus and what needs to be to done to complete that task. Overall we believe that this approach aided greatly in the overall production of our product, given how much has been produced over the period of the project. I believe having weekly stand-up meetings and ensuring absolute attendance throughout would have made our meetings more productive and collaborative, but with life comes complications so attendance cannot ever be 100 percent guaranteed, and doing so this definitely affected our teams production. The important thing with scrum meetings is that it is a collaborative effort and without every team member attending it can cause negative impacts on production and task assignment.

When we began our project we started off instantly by creating a FaceBook Messenger group chat to allow our team to instantly message each other and receive in app and global notifications for when one of us sent a message. However we were instructed to not use this method and use Jira comments instead. Our team believe that Jira comments are extremely clunky, inefficient and very easy to look over when viewing tasks and issues in the backlog. For the first few weeks we stuck to using Jira, however it became clear that this method was negatively impacting our team as some members would not receive notifications or would not even see the comment which were posted. To resolve this we reverted back to FaceBook Messenger which is much better overall as it is easy to use and extremely effective at its purpose of bring people together. We were able to share images, links and arrange meetings using this tool and it has aided in our teams ability to collaborate greatly. I believe most individuals who partook in this project would agree with our views on Jira's communication abilities which in our opinion are next to null.

Our standup meeting was held on [06-02-19] and it involved each team member providing their view on where our product stands in its current state and what we were going to do to improve that state in the coming weeks. These meetings are very effective as they allow for a more involved and more intuitive experience as every member has to stand and share their ideas and views on the product. It is important to keep these short as discomfort can be caused from standing for too long. To record what each individual had to say we each wrote a comment to summarise what was said.

One way to improve the effectiveness of these standup meetings would be to ensure everyone has to have some input. This could be to demonstrate a future implementation for the program or to share a idea or view of a future implementation.

Overall I believe our teams production performance to be very high however this is greatly outweighed by the fact that the programming was not shared between the team equally or effectively. No matter how many tasks were assigned to each individual, it fels like the tasks would fall onto the most able individual on the team to complete which isn't effective nor is it fair. For future sprints, implementations or future projects our team really need to prove what they can do when actually combining all coding abilities by motivating themselves and eachother to push more onto coding.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion
In the early stages of development, as with everyone else new to Jira our team were still learning the ropes of Jira sprints and issue creation and issue assignment and this is shown from week 1 until week 4. From week 7 on wards there is a massive improvement of how many sprint issues were completed and assigned. The backlog also got a lot cleaner as well as out active sprint sections. This is because by then we felt as if we understood what was required of us and we grasped the Jira basics.  
From the burndown charts we can see that progress in the beginning was slow and not many issues were getting completed, but later on in development say week 10 there are many issues being completed. The burndown charts indicate what occurred on what stages of development, for example after the Minimal viable product was submitted there were many ideas for the program to be implemented and we can see that as we progressively implemented these there is a resemblance to how many issues were completed in Jira as replicated in the burndown charts.  
To improve our teams velocity / estimation ability in future sprints we have come to the agreement that we would each dedicate a day to focus on our module CE291. We would each find a day where we would spend around 4 hours on our assigned task to ensure that we would complete or make significant progress on it. We have also found that under estimating time frames for completion can cause complications, for example when we were in the early stages of development, we were struggling to visualize what we were making because we had not created the GUI or Menu Frame at this point. This made it difficult to visualize how we were meant to navigate through the program. This issue was definitely completed slightly too late and it negatively impacted our team, however once it was implemented and fully functional we were able to begin combining our work to piece together the program.  
To prevent this in future sprints I recommend that we be honest with each other and our selves about how long an implementation may take so we do not impact our whole team if wee need more time on said implementation or task. Our team have agreed that the final sprint report is something to behold as it is a sign of achievement and also brings a great sigh of relief. It is a beautiful sight as all tasks in the backlog fade away to 'done' and active sprints looks like a newly added blank JTextarea. It shows what our team is capable of when we all push together to get our quality product completed and polished.

## Other Areas
### Final Sprint Overview
In the image below is of our most recent sprint. You can see that there are already an extensive range of jira methodologies used such as subtasks, comments, and flagging. Every one of these methods promotes development to others even further. Using this aided in producing some implementations at speed.

#### User Requirements
For our programs user requirements we created an Epic which would allow us to add tasks and issues which were essential for our program to be a success. Below is the screenshot of the chart.
