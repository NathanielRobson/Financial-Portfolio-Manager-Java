# Marketing Plan

*Expand upon the marketing plan slide from the CE29x lecture on Marketing.  Hints are given below.*


# Customers

The likely interest for the customers would be those that range from the ages 18 and upwards. This age had been selected since the customers must have some prior knowledge even if a little, of how the stock market works. Furthermore, the app does not need a skill gap for the customers as it has a relatively simple interface, meaning that all from the most experienced user to the least experienced user will be able effectively use the app. 
As it would be a mobile application, we have decided to role out our product to the major markers such as the Uk, USA, certain countries in Europe such as France and Germany. The app could then be rolled over to other markets if the demand is there and also if it is succesful in the initial set of countries.

# Economics
According to Broker Notes, it show that there were 13.9 million online traders in 2018 which was up from the previous year’s 9.6 million which is an increase of 4.3million or just under 50%. This is likely to increase as more people start to become interested in trading. 

Market trends may vary based upon the age group of any said demographic. This suggest that there is not any one said given trend for the entire market as some may chose to trade in only currencies and others may chose to trade stocks or bunds. The former market trend for ager group 18-35 was crypto-currencies due to high return values. However due to the decline of the crypto market, this trend has died with it.  

The demand for user friendly financial portfolio has been on the rise. This new demand can be explained due to the overwhelming amounts of users that are downloading and using financial portfolios/trading applications.  

Coming into the market, we will have a small market share at first compared to the well-established programs. This estimation would between 0.5%-2%. But as the market grows, the company aims to have a 15%-30% share of the market. 

# Competition

Whilst browsing the market, there was a lot of products/services that were similar to ours. This brought up a few concerns as it means that we would have to burst into a market that already has few well established products . The list of established products which are very similar to the product that we are delivering are: 

Yahoo Finance 

RobinHood 

Trading212 

TD Ameritrade.

What our product does differently from the Yahoo finance is that it displays the graph as a bar chart rather than a stock chart. This could give our product an advantage over competitors as it makes the graph easier to read for newer customers who may not understand what the stock graph may represent. 

Below shows the Main Menu for our financial portfolio. As it shows it is straight to the point and has buttons for every function that our program has to offer.

What our competitors apps do differently from ours varies upon which trading app/ financial portfolio. As shown with Yahoo Finance, it does not offer any services that involve trading rather services that would help the customer customise the application. On the other hand, Trading212 has a similar function to ours. The difference is that Trading212 main menu does not allow them to either invest or view investment.  

These features would put us at an advantage over our competitors as it cuts out what could be “unnecessary” navigation. Another advantage that our product has is that our product can be used worldwide. This is an advantage that is most notably against RobinHood as it cannot be accessed by the UK Apple App Store. 

Our main advantage over our competitors is that our app can be operated offline. This means that customers are able to log in to view their investments and as long as they have previously downloaded the most recent shares information. For example, this will allow the customer to compare their investments to current or the most recent stocks if they were to go underground or were under a tunnel. 

Other advantages although they may be minor, are that our document will provide documentation throughout and it will continue to update itself over time without the user having to feel outdated. 


# Product, Price, Promotion, Place
Price: For our product, we aim to make it a monthly subscription that could be paid by PayPal or direct debit. Compared to our direct competitors such as Yahoo Finance and RobinHood, we aim to have the same premium monthly services but at a lower cost. This is as Yahoo finance are aiming to introduce a monthly service which would cost up to $100 or £76.24. Whereas RobinHood already has an established subscription ranges from $40 or £30.50 to $60 or £45.75 monthly. To have an edge over the market, we have established that a monthly subscription fee of $25 to customers in the United States , £25 to customers within the UK and €25 to customers within Europe.. 

Promotion: Due to having such a wide demographic and a wide geographic release, we aim to promote our products using major advertising techniques such as Television and internet advertising. As there are many products that will be selling the same or similar services, our main marketing technique that we aim to get across is that the customer can use the service without the need for an internet connection (if they’re using a mobile device). However, the use of television and internet advertising will need to be on a moderate level as it may cause a negative backlash as it may be perceived to be annoying. 

Place: For our product to be distributed, it would needed to be put on major mobile platforms such as IOS App Store and the Android App Store/Google Play Store. To also distribute our service, we will aim to put in on a website so that the customers can use if they are unable to check up on their mobile device. This will effectively reduce the need for a middle man as some users may sign up for the subscription via the website.  

Spending on Internet advertising has reached $137.5 billion and is expected to pass TV advertising within a couple of years. This has led the team to believe that internet advertising is major way that we should promote our product. 

As a group we had decided that using a email marketing and search engine optimisation would be the best ways that enabled us to advertise the product and reach a large audience as well as our potential target audience.

Using a mid-sized agency to aid with the Search Engine Optimisation otherwise known as SEO could set the team back £1500 monthly. Using Email Marketing could cost between $300 or £228 a month to $500 or £380 a month excluding set up fees and the $0.03 per recipient. Using email marketing could be very beneficial as it would help the many subscribers of the product. As it is a start-up, initially only £500 could be spent to set up the mid-range server. 

£1500 + £380 + £500 = £2380. This will be the cost to acquire a server and factoring in the costs for advertising. However, it can be noted that the server set up could be a onetime event. Taking these into consideration, the costs could be lower on a monthly basis by £500. However, if the company were to expand at an exponential rate, then the costs to set up to accommodate the newer users could range from £500 for a mid-range server to £800+ for a high-end server. Furthermore, the cost to using the email marketing advertisement technique would also increase.
