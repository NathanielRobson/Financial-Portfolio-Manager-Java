# Marketing Plan

*Expand upon the marketing plan slide from the CE29x lecture on Marketing.  Hints are given below.*


# Customers

The likely interest for the customers would be those that range from the ages 18 and upwards. This age had been selected since the customers must have some prior knowledge even if a little, of how the stock market works. Furthermore, the app does not need a skill gap for the customers as it has a relatively simple interface, meaning that all from the most experienced user to the least experienced user will be able effectively use the app. 

# Economics
* What is the total size of your market?
* What percent share of the market will you have?
* What is the current demand in target market?
* What are the trends in target market?

# Competition

What our product does differently from the Yahoo finance is that it displays the graph as a bar chart rather than a stock chart. This could give our product an advantage over competitors as it makes the graph easier to read for newer customers who may not understand what the stock graph may represent.

Below shows the Main Menu for our financial portfolio. As it shows it is straight to the point and has buttons for every function that our program has to offer.

What our competitors apps do differently from ours varies upon which trading app/ financial portfolio. As shown with Yahoo Finance, it does not offer any services that involve trading rather services that would help the customer customise the application. On the other hand, Trading212 has a similar function to ours. The difference is that Trading212 main menu does not allow them to either invest or view investment.  

These features would put us at an advantage over our competitors as it cuts out what could be “unnecessary” 


# Product, Price, Promotion, Place
Price: For our product, we aim to make it a monthly subscription that could be paid by PayPal or direct debit. Compared to our direct competitors such as Yahoo Finance and RobinHood, we aim to have the same premium monthly services but at a lower cost. This is as Yahoo finance are aiming to introduce a monthly service which would cost up to $100 or £76.24. Whereas RobinHood already has an established subscription ranges from $40 or £30.50 to $60 or £45.75 monthly. To have an edge over the market, we have established that a monthly subscription fee of $25 to customers in the United States , £25 to customers within the UK and €25 to customers within Europe.. 

Promotion: Due to having such a wide demographic and a wide geographic release, we aim to promote our products using major advertising techniques such as Television and internet advertising. As there are many products that will be selling the same or similar services, our main marketing technique that we aim to get across is that the customer can use the service without the need for an internet connection (if they’re using a mobile device). However, the use of television and internet advertising will need to be on a moderate level as it may cause a negative backlash as it may be perceived to be annoying. 

Place: For our product to be distributed, it would needed to be put on major mobile platforms such as IOS App Store and the Android App Store/Google Play Store. To also distribute our service, we will aim to put in on a website so that the customers can use if they are unable to check up on their mobile device. This will effectively reduce the need for a middle man as some users may sign up for the subscription via the website.  

Spending on Internet advertising has reached $137.5 billion and is expected to pass TV advertising within a couple of years. This has led the team to believe that internet advertising is major way that we should promote our product. 

As a group we had decided that using a email marketing and search engine optimisation would be the best ways that enabled us to advertise the product and reach a large audience as well as our potential target audience.

Using a mid-sized agency to aid with the Search Engine Optimisation otherwise known as SEO could set the team back £1500 monthly. Using Email Marketing could cost between $300 or £228 a month to $500 or £380 a month excluding set up fees and the $0.03 per recipient. Using email marketing could be very beneficial as it would help the many subscribers of the product. As it is a start-up, initially only £500 could be spent to set up the mid-range server. 

£1500 + £380 + £500 = £2380. This will be the cost to acquire a server and factoring in the costs for advertising. However, it can be noted that the server set up could be a onetime event. Taking these into consideration, the costs could be lower on a monthly basis by £500. However, if the company were to expand at an exponential rate, then the costs to set up to accommodate the newer users could range from £500 for a mid-range server to £800+ for a high-end server. Furthermore, the cost to using the email marketing advertisement technique would also increase.
